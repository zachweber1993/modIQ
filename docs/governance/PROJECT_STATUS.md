# Current Milestone

## Sprint 1 — Complete

Sprint 0 is complete. The engineering foundation was established, including workspace scaffolding, repository governance, crate hierarchy, module hierarchy, documentation hierarchy, architecture verification, and a clean workspace build.

Sprint 1 delivered the first complete, deterministic Assessment pipeline: Assessment creation, Evidence collection, deterministic Rule evaluation, Finding and Recommendation generation, Assessment Report generation, and Assessment completion, composed into one executable operation (`AssessmentService::execute`) and exercised end to end by integration tests. The repository was tagged `v0.1.0-alpha`. Full record: `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_v0.1.0-alpha.md`, `HANDOFF_SPRINT1.md`.

## Sprint 2 — Complete

Sprint 2 gave Evidence, Finding, and Recommendation — content-free in Sprint 1 — real field content, identity, and constructor validation, and extended `Assessment` with relationship-resolution methods (`evidence_by_id`, `finding_by_id`, `evidence_for_finding`, `findings_for_recommendation`). No Rule Engine, Reporting, or Engine orchestration behavior changed; no Knowledge Domain integration began. Two content-level invariants were identified and deliberately left unenforced, recorded as Governance Register items GOV-005 and GOV-006. The workspace test suite grew from 55 to 97 tests. Full record: `docs/releases/ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.2.md`, `SPRINT2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, ADR-0007.

## Sprint 3 — Complete

Sprint 3 delivered the Evidence Collection subsystem, from architectural boundary through its first real capability, across five phases: Sandbox real-pipeline integration (Phase 1); GOV-005/GOV-006 minimum reference cardinality (Phase 2, INV-013/INV-014); the Evidence Collection Subsystem Boundary architecture (Phase 3, ADR-0008, ADR-0009, Documentation Release 2.1); a minimal `modiq-collection` crate proving the boundary (Phase 4, GOV-007); and the first real, filesystem-backed collector (Phase 5, GOV-009/GOV-010, deterministic traversal, the four-outcome Collection Error Model, Collection Atomicity, the Symbolic Link Policy). The workspace grew to nine crates; the root test suite grew from 97 to 112 tests. Full record: `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.3.md`.

## Platform Validation Phase 1 — Complete

Following Engineering Release 0.3, a Platform Validation cycle reviewed accumulated architectural assumptions against three Sprints of implementation evidence (`PROPOSAL_PLATFORM_VALIDATION_REVIEW.md`). GOV-004 (Engine Service Granularity) was evaluated, approved, and implemented: `AssessmentService` direct subsystem composition is the confirmed engine architecture, and the unused internal `EngineAPI` service model (and its `modiq-rules` mirror) was removed. GOV-008 (AssessmentService Public API Evolution) was evaluated and deferred: implementation evidence was found insufficient to resolve it, no architectural change was authorized, and the current `AssessmentService` execution contract remains the approved platform boundary pending future implementation evidence. Architecture validated for continued roadmap execution. Full record: `docs/engineering/ENGINEERING_LOG.md`.

**Next implementation milestone (superseded by Sprint 4, below):** ZIP / Archive Evidence Collection, the platform's second real Evidence Collector — see `docs/engineering/PROPOSAL_ZIP_EVIDENCE_COLLECTION.md`. CLI wiring remains a separately available, low-risk parallel track, not yet scoped in detail.

## Sprint 4 — Complete

Sprint 4 delivered the platform's second real Evidence Collector, archive-based, across four implementation phases plus a governance-resolution and boundary-proving cycle. GOV-011 (Archive Collection Model) was resolved in its entirety (`PROPOSAL_GOV-011.md`), informed by Phase 2's empirical investigation of the `zip` crate (v8.6.0) — the platform's first archive-parsing dependency and first genuinely adversarial input surface. Phase 3A implemented deterministic archive structural enumeration (`ArchiveReader`); Phase 3B transformed that structure into real Evidence (`ArchiveEvidenceBuilder`), reusing `EvidenceCategory::FileStructureAnalysis` unchanged; Phase 3C assembled both with GOV-011's three remaining policies (resource limits, the Archive Traversal Boundary Policy, and the Duplicate Archive Entry Policy) into one real Collector (`ArchiveCollector`), introducing one new closed-set category, `EvidenceCategory::StructuralDuplication`, following a dedicated Architecture Review (`PROPOSAL_GOV-011_DUPLICATE_REPRESENTATION.md`); Phase 3D wired `ArchiveCollector` into `AssessmentService` via one explicit, inline routing check, completing the platform's first end-to-end archive assessment path. No collector-dispatch abstraction was introduced at any phase. A Sprint 4 Closeout reconciled repository documentation, validated the archive path through the Sandbox application against a checked-in fixture, and produced an engineering retrospective (recorded inside `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.4.md` itself, per this project's established pattern of housing a release's retrospective in its own release document rather than a separate file). The workspace grew from 112 to 150 root tests (Sandbox: 3 to 6); nine workspace crates, unchanged in count. Full record: `docs/engineering/ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.4.md`.

## Sprint 5 — Complete

Sprint 5 deliberately did not add a third Evidence Collector; per Technical Director direction, it strengthened the platform vertically instead, building the assessment intelligence layer — the Rule Engine's own depth — before widening Evidence Collection further. GOV-012 (Rule Evaluation Model) was resolved: `RuleEngine::evaluate` returns `Vec<RuleOutcome>`, Rules are dispatched in fixed, explicit declaration order, and compose independently with no suppression model. GOV-013 (FindingSeverity Severity/Kind Conflation) was opened, deliberately Open, not Resolved — the Technical Director accepted a real architectural tension (`BestPractice` classifies Finding *kind*, not severity, unlike `Error`/`Warning`/`Informational`) as provisionally accepted rather than deciding a Runtime model change from two Rules alone, to be revisited once more concrete Rules exist. `DataModel.md` was amended to v1.1.0 with the platform's first specification-level Finding Severity definitions. `modiq-rules` gained its second concrete Rule, `StructuralDuplicationRule` (Phase 2), and the original Sprint 1 Rule was extracted into its own unit, `EvidencePresenceRule`, both dispatched by the new multi-Rule `RuleEngine::evaluate` (Phase 3) — no trait, registry, or dispatch abstraction introduced. A dedicated investigation (Phase 4) recommended retiring `modiq-report`'s four unused scaffold types (`FindingSummary`, `RecommendationSummary`, `TraceabilityReport`, `ReportFormatter`), using the same evidentiary method GOV-004 used, but no action was taken this Sprint. Phase 5 closed one determinism-testing gap (Rule outcome order confirmed independent of Evidence arrival order, not just repeated-identical-input order). A Sprint 5 Closeout reconciled repository documentation and produced an engineering retrospective (inside `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.5.md`). The workspace grew from 150 to 162 root tests (Sandbox unchanged at 6); nine workspace crates, unchanged in count. Full record: `docs/engineering/ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.5.md`.

## Sprint 6 — Complete (Implementation and Merge)

Sprint 6 closed two of the three roadmap candidates named at Sprint 5 Closeout. `modiq-cli` was wired to `modiq-engine` for the first time since Sprint 0: `Application` dispatches `assess`/`help`/`version` by one direct match (no command trait or registry); `AssessCommand` calls `AssessmentService::execute_from_assessment_input` against a real, user-supplied path — the same entry point the Sandbox already calls, reused rather than reinvented — mapping the result to a three-tier exit-code convention (0 success, 1 execution failure, 2 invalid usage). `modiq-report`'s four scaffold types recommended for retirement at Sprint 5 Phase 4 (`FindingSummary`, `RecommendationSummary`, `TraceabilityReport`, `ReportFormatter`) were deleted under this Sprint's explicit Chief Architect authorization; `AssessmentReport`, the crate's real, tested content, is unchanged. No change to `AssessmentService`'s public entry points, `AssessmentInput`, or the public error model. `modiq-cli` advanced from L1 to L2. The workspace grew from 162 to 172 root tests (`modiq-cli` 0 → 10; `modiq-report` unchanged at 3, confirming the deletion had zero test-coverage impact); Sandbox reverified unchanged at 6/6. Implementation was committed (`397707f`) on `feature/sprint6-cli`, reviewed, and merged into `feature/runtime-implementation` (`29657df`) with a full post-merge revalidation. Full record: `docs/engineering/SPRINT6_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (including its Authorization Record), `docs/engineering/POST_SPRINT6_REPOSITORY_ASSESSMENT.md`, and `docs/engineering/ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.6.md` (produced retroactively alongside `_0.7.md`, after Sprint 7's own close — see `HISTORICAL_RELEASE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`).

## Sprint 7 — Complete (Multi-Source Evidence Collection: XML Inspection)

Sprint 7 closed the sole remaining candidate from the original three-item Sprint 6 roadmap. Rather than beginning with implementation, Sprint 7 began with a capability question — "what new capability should XML inspection provide?" — and, when that surfaced the platform's first need for more than one Collector to run per Assessment, was preceded by a dedicated Architecture Evaluation (`COLLECTOR_COMPOSITION_ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md`) before any code was written. The approved architecture: Collection is a phase of an Assessment, not a standalone component; Collectors remain fully independent and never consume one another's output; composition is direct and inline inside `AssessmentService`, with no `CollectionCoordinator` introduced. `XmlCollector` now runs alongside the existing structural Collector for every Assessment, producing `XmlInspection` Evidence — manifest presence, well-formedness, and declared dependencies — with a missing manifest itself recorded as Evidence rather than silently treated as Empty Collection. No Rule Engine change; `modiq-rules` is untouched. New dependency: `roxmltree`. The workspace grew from 172 to 187 root tests (Sandbox 6 → 7). Implementation committed and pushed directly to `feature/runtime-implementation` (`277aefd`) — no separate Sprint branch was created this cycle, unlike Sprint 6.

Sprint 7 also consolidated the repository's engineering workflow: nine independent, drifted workflow descriptions (`ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_CONSOLIDATION_STUDY.md`) reduced to one canonical source (`PROJECT_HANDOFF_v1.0.md`, Section 5), terminology unified project-wide, `ImplementationWorkflow.md` archived as non-normative history, and the Implementation Report template reconciled with demonstrated Sprint 6/7 practice (`ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md`). The engineering methodology is now designated **Version 1.0** — exercised across multiple completed Sprints, consolidated into one canonical process, and expected to evolve only through the same evidence-based process used throughout this repository, not routine amendment.

Full record: `SPRINT7_CAPABILITY_AND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `COLLECTOR_COMPOSITION_ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md`, `SPRINT7_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZATION.md`, `SPRINT7_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, `ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_CONSOLIDATION_STUDY.md`, `ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md`, and `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.7.md`. `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.6.md` and `_0.7.md` were both produced retroactively, after this Sprint's own close — see `HISTORICAL_RELEASE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` for how, and for the process risk this gap itself represents.

**Next implementation milestone (superseded by Sprint 8, below):** Version Profile-aware compatibility checking — the candidate `REPOSITORY_CLOSEOUT_REPORT.md` (Sprint 7) named as the clearest concrete beneficiary of Sprint 7's own work.

## Sprint 8 — Complete (Version Profile-aware Compatibility Checking)

Sprint 8 activated the Version Profile architectural dimension — specified since Documentation Release 1.0 (`VersionProfile.md`, ADR-0004) but unimplemented through seven Sprints — as the platform's first capability directly answering `ProductSpecification.md`'s named Player objective, "Compatibility Verification." Preceded by the full Capability Definition → Architecture Evaluation → Architectural Resolution → Implementation Authorization sequence: `SPRINT8_INITIALIZATION_REPORT.md` (repository orientation), `SPRINT8_CAPABILITY_AND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (capability definition and repository evidence, including a direct correction of a prior session's inaccurate "declared FS version already exists" framing), `SPRINT8_ARCHITECTURAL_RESOLUTION.md` (six architectural decisions evaluated, none resolved), and `SPRINT8_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZATION.md` (decisions validated against fresh repository evidence, implementation roadmap, Builder-pattern evaluation).

`modiq-versioning` gained its first real content since Sprint 0: a minimal `GameVersion`/`VersionProfile` pair, with a single hardcoded `VersionProfile::fs25()` recognizing `descVersion` 93 — deliberately not exhaustive version knowledge. `XmlCollector` (Sprint 7) was extended to extract a mod's declared `descVersion` as a purely factual `XmlInspection` Evidence item, preserving the Collector Contract's observational boundary exactly. A new Rule, `VersionCompatibilityRule`, evaluates that declared value against the active Version Profile inside the Rule Engine — never upstream of it — producing a `Warning` Finding when unrecognized. `Assessment` records which Version Profile governed it through a new opaque `VersionProfileReference`, extending ADR-0007's established Opaque Runtime References pattern to a domain relationship for the first time; `modiq-runtime` gained no new dependency and remains the platform's sole dependency-free leaf, unbroken since Sprint 0. `AssessmentService`'s two public entry points (`execute`, `execute_from_assessment_input`) required **zero signature change** — both now execute every Assessment against `VersionProfile::fs25()` internally, an implementation simplification the Chief Architect accepted as part of this Sprint rather than the anticipated new additive entry point, since no second Version Profile yet exists for a caller to select between.

The workspace grew from 187 to 205 root tests (`modiq-versioning` 0 → 4, its first tests ever; `modiq-rules` 15 → 25; `modiq-runtime` 82 → 84; `modiq-collection` 56 → 57; `modiq-engine` 18 → 19 unit); Sandbox unchanged at 7/7, requiring zero source modification. Two new internal dependency edges only (`modiq-engine`/`modiq-rules` → `modiq-versioning`), no new external dependency, no breaking public API change. Full record: `SPRINT8_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md`, `SPRINT8_IMPLEMENTATION_DEVIATIONS.md`, and `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.8.md`.

## Sprint 9 — Complete (Repair Guidance: Minimum Viable `modiq-knowledge` Activation)

Sprint 9 activated `modiq-knowledge` — real content since Sprint 0 — through the platform's first Repair Guidance capability, directly answering `Vision.md`'s own least-served founding Assessment question, "what can I do next?" Preceded by the full Capability Definition → Architectural Resolution → Implementation → Repository Review sequence, each producing its own reviewed document: `SPRINT9_CAPABILITY_DEFINITION.md`, `SPRINT9_ARCHITECTURAL_RESOLUTION.md`, `SPRINT9_REPOSITORY_REVIEW.md`. During Architectural Resolution review, the Chief Architect identified and corrected a conflation in the initial draft's Question 2 (where a `RepairRecipe` is retrieved versus where its content is authored) before implementation began — the resolution was revised so that `modiq-knowledge`, not the consuming Rule, authors engineering knowledge, consistent with the crate's own README boundary.

`RepairRecipe` gained real content: `identifier`/`guidance` fields, an infallible constructor, and one named, authored recipe, `RepairRecipe::version_compatibility_declared_version_mismatch()`, mirroring `VersionProfile::fs25()`'s exact precedent (a specific minimum-viable value authored inside the domain crate itself). `VersionCompatibilityRule` now calls this recipe rather than authoring guidance text inline, wiring a real `Some(RepairRecipeReference)` into its `Recommendation` in place of `None`. `RepairRecipeReference` — real, tested, and unused since Sprint 2 — required no modification, its third proven instance of ADR-0007's Opaque Runtime References pattern. `RuleEngine::evaluate` and `AssessmentService`'s two public entry points required **zero signature change**: the capability's entire footprint is one new dependency edge, `modiq-rules` → `modiq-knowledge`, mirroring Sprint 8's own `modiq-rules` → `modiq-versioning` edge.

The workspace grew from 205 to 210 root tests (`modiq-knowledge` 0 → 5, its first tests ever; `modiq-rules` and `modiq-engine` unchanged in count, both extended in place); Sandbox unchanged at 7/7. No new Governance Register item, no ADR, no `GOVERNANCE.md` amendment — the Knowledge Domain boundary already named Repair Recipes explicitly; no gap was found, unlike Sprint 8's `modiq-versioning` boundary gap. Full record: `SPRINT9_CAPABILITY_DEFINITION.md`, `SPRINT9_ARCHITECTURAL_RESOLUTION.md`, `SPRINT9_REPOSITORY_REVIEW.md`, and `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.9.md`.

**Next implementation milestone:** not yet scoped for implementation. The frozen roadmap (`SPRINT_ROADMAP_UPDATE_v1.md`) names Runtime Log Interpretation as the Sprint 10 candidate, contingent on Sprint 9's own successful closeout (now complete) — Sprint 10 Capability Definition should still confirm this against fresh repository evidence rather than assume it, per this project's own standing discipline.

# Documentation Release Status

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Current Release** | Documentation Release 2.1 |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete (Frozen) |
| **Constitutional Layer** | ✅ Frozen |
| **Architecture Layer** | ✅ Frozen (amended under 2.1 — Evidence Collection named a Core Platform Component; Assessment Lifecycle diagram ordering corrected) |
| **Technical Layer** | ✅ Frozen (new: `EvidenceCollection.md`) |
| **Governance Documentation** | ✅ Reconciled |
| **Repository Audit** | ✅ Passed |
| **Implementation Readiness** | ✅ Verified |
| **Previous Release** | Documentation Release 2.0 |

Governance documentation (EngineeringGuide.md, CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md, PROJECT_STATUS.md, and related tracking documents) is reconciled with current repository state as of this release. Unlike the constitutional and architecture layers, governance documentation remains a living body of documentation per EngineeringGuide.md and is not designated Frozen — and, as `ENGINEERING_RELEASE_0.3.md`'s Repository Health section notes directly, has a documented history of falling behind between releases despite that.

# Current Focus

Documentation Releases 1.0, 2.0, and 2.1 have all concluded; Documentation Release 2.1 (Evidence Collection subsystem boundary) is the current one, amended three times since its own freeze to record GOV-011's resolution and its Sprint 4 Phase 3C/3D implementation (`EvidenceCollection.md` v1.2.0 → v1.4.0). `DataModel.md` was separately amended to v1.1.0 during Sprint 5 to add Finding Severity definitions (GOV-012/GOV-013). Engineering Release 0.4 froze Sprint 4 (Phases 1–3D, plus Closeout); Engineering Release 0.5 froze Sprint 5 (Phases 1–5, plus Closeout). Platform Validation Phase 1 closed before Sprint 4 began, confirming the engine architecture (GOV-004) and deferring GOV-008 pending future evidence — GOV-008 remains open, untouched by Sprints 4, 5, and 6 (Sprint 6 reused `AssessmentService`'s existing entry points exactly as designed and generated no new evidence toward it). Sprint 6 is complete: `modiq-cli` is wired to `modiq-engine`, and `modiq-report`'s four scaffold types are retired. XML inspection is the sole remaining candidate from the original three-item Sprint 6 roadmap, not yet scoped for Sprint 7.

Sprint 7 (Multi-Source Evidence Collection: XML inspection), Sprint 8 (Version Profile-aware compatibility checking), and Sprint 9 (Repair Guidance) are all complete since this paragraph was last current. None required a Documentation Release amendment; Documentation Release 2.1 remains the current release. GOV-008 remains open, now unaffected by Sprint 9 as well — `AssessmentService`'s two public entry points required no signature change this Sprint either, generating no new evidence toward resolving it, the same non-outcome every Sprint since Sprint 6 has already produced. Sprint 9 gave `modiq-knowledge` its first real content since Sprint 0, the platform's first Repair Guidance capability, and its own Sprint-9-specific process finding: the Chief Architect's Architectural Resolution review caught and corrected a knowledge-ownership conflation before implementation began (see Sprint 9's own record).

Implementation should remain consistent with the frozen engineering specification.

---

# Implementation Policy

The documentation contained within this repository is the authoritative engineering specification for modIQ.

Implementation should reconcile all engineering decisions against the frozen specifications.

Architectural changes should be introduced through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and incorporated into future Documentation Releases rather than modifying Documentation Release 1.0.

---

## Governance Status

Status: Frozen for Sprint 6, carried into Sprints 7, 8, and 9 (all four complete); baseline carries forward unchanged into Sprint 10. Engineering Methodology Version 1.0 declared following Sprint 7 (`PROJECT_HANDOFF_v1.0.md`, Section 5) — a versioning of the workflow itself, distinct from this governance baseline. Sprint 9 introduced no Governance Register item, no ADR, and no Crate Boundary Rule update — the Knowledge Domain boundary section in `GOVERNANCE.md` already named Repair Recipes explicitly before this Sprint began, so (unlike Sprint 8's `modiq-versioning` gap) no amendment was needed. The `modiq-versioning` Crate Boundary Rules gap named during Sprint 8 planning remains open, unaffected by Sprint 9.

The project's governance baseline is established.

Authoritative governance documents:

- PROJECT_HANDOFF_v1.0.md
- CHIEF_ARCHITECT_HANDOFF_v1.0.md
- LEAD_ENGINEER_HANDOFF_v3.0.md

Future governance changes must be justified by implementation evidence,
architectural evolution, or approved governance decisions.

Sprint 10 begins under this governance baseline.
